Scripts and data for Cu–Pb–Zn mapping with OK, RF, XGBoost

# Code and data for Cu–Pb–Zn spatial modelling (OK vs ML)
This repository provides the analysis scripts and input dataset used to reproduce
the model-comparison results.

## Contents
- `Suppl_material.csv`  
  Single input table containing sample coordinates, target variables (Cu, Pb, Zn),
  and all predictor variables used by the models.

- `01_choose_best_vario_model.py`  
  Selects the best variogram model per element using LOOCV metrics.

- `02_kriging_results.py`  
  Runs Ordinary Kriging (OK) with the selected variogram model(s) and reports
  LOOCV performance metrics (RMSE, MAE, ME, R²).

- `03_random_forest.py`  
  Baseline Random Forest regression and LOOCV metrics.

- `04_XGBoost.py`  
  Baseline XGBoost regression and LOOCV metrics.

- `05_RF_Spatial.py`  
  Spatially enhanced Random Forest regression and LOOCV metrics.

- `06_XGBoost_Spatial.py`  
  Spatially enhanced XGBoost regression and LOOCV metrics.

## How to run
All scripts read the same input file (`Suppl_material.csv`) and print results to the console.
No output files are generated by these scripts.

### 1) Create an environment (recommended)
Install Python 3.10+ (or Anaconda) and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
